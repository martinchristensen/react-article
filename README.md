# react-article

> This package makes it easy to set up articles for web app with react components. I created this package to make the process, of creating technical articles, fast and easy for my own website. I then decided to publish this package for everyone with similar needs to use.
> Feel free to suggest or PR for new features and/or optimization of existing ones.
